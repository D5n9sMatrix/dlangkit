The existence of inverses for elementary row operations and hence for elementary operations on a system
of equations, gives:
Proof of Theorem 1.1.1. Suppose that a system of linear equations is transformed into a new system
by a sequence of elementary operations. Then every solution of the original system is automatically a
solution of the new system because adding equations, or multiplying an equation by a nonzero number,
always results in a valid equation. In the same way, each solution of the new system must be a solution
to the original system because the original system can be obtained from the new one by another series of
elementary operations (the inverses of the originals). It follows that the original and new systems have the
same solutions. This proves Theorem 1.1.1.
