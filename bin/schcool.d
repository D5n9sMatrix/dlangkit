/*
The proof is given at the end of this section.
Elementary operations performed on a system of equations produce corresponding manipulations of
the rows of the augmented matrix. Thus, multiplying a row of a matrix by a number k means multiplying
every entry of the row by k. Adding one row to another row means adding each entry of that row to the
corresponding entry of the other row. Subtracting two rows is done similarly. Note that we regard two
rows as equal when corresponding entries are the same.
In hand calculations (and in computer programs) we manipulate the rows of the augmented matrix
rather than the equations. For this reason we restate these elementary operations for matrices.
