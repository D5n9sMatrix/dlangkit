/*
Any type, built-in or user-defined, can be attributed to functions. The function foo()
in this example will have the attributes "Hello" (type string) and Bar (type Bar with
value 10). To get the attributes of a function (or type) use the built-in compiler
traits __traits(getAttributes, Foo) which returns an AliasSeq.

UDAs allow generic code to be enhanced by giving user-defined types another dimension
that helps compile time generators to adapt to that specific type.
