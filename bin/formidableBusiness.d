Any function or operation on SafeInt that can't be handled by the type itself will be forwarded
to the alias thised member. From the outside SafeInt then looks like a normal integer.

This allows extending other types with new functionality but with zero overhead in terms of memory
or runtime. The compiler makes sure to do the right thing when accessing the alias this member.
